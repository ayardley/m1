TODO
====

* implement parameter and argument handling
* implement namespaces and their handling
* implement pointers properly in the parser
* implement structs or other aggregate types; PMCs native?
* any other keywords? e.g., continue? 
* implement semantic checker (a thorough one!)
* finish code generator
* implement constant and variable declarations
* do we want member functions: x.y(); ? (prob for PMCs)
* exception handling at this level?
* make compiler re-entrant
* improve symbol table handling
* free all memory after done.
